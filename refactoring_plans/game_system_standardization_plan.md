# Game System Standardization Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation strategy for addressing inconsistent game system naming across the application. Currently, the same game system can be categorized in multiple ways (e.g., "D&D", "Dungeons & Dragons", "dnd"), which creates issues for filtering and organization. The plan includes the development of an admin tool for manual standardization and the groundwork for future automated cleanup.

## Current State
- Game system names are inconsistently formatted across quest cards
- Same game systems may be entered differently (e.g., "D&D", "Dungeons & Dragons", "dnd")
- No standardization mechanism exists for game system names
- Filter functionality is impacted by these inconsistencies, leading to incomplete query results
- No admin tools exist for managing or normalizing game system data

## Phase 1: Analysis & Data Structure Updates ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Analyze current data patterns and establish a data structure to support standardized game systems

1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Extract all unique game system values from the database ✅
   - Identify common variations and groupings (e.g., all D&D variations) ✅
   - Quantify the scale of the issue (number of affected records, number of variation groups) ✅
   - Generate report of most common variations for each system ✅

2. **Standard System Registry**:
   - Design a `game_systems` collection in Firestore ✅
     - Fields: `standardId`, `standardName`, `aliases`, `icon`, `editions`, `publisher`, `description`
     - Include metadata like creation date, last modified
   - Create initial list of standard game systems with official names ✅
   - Develop schema for system variations and aliases ✅
   - Add support for system editions as subcategories ✅

3. **Schema Updates**:
   - Modify quest card schema to include both original and standardized system fields ✅
