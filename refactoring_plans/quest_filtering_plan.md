# Quest Filtering Feature Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation strategy for adding filtering capabilities to both the public and authenticated quest card list views. The filtering system will allow users to narrow down quest cards based on various attributes, improving user experience and making it easier to find relevant content.

## Current State
- Public and authenticated quest list views display all quests without filtering
