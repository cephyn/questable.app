## Getting Started

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.
